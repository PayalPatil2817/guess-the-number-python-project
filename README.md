# guess-the-number-python-project

Python program in which the computer randomly selects the number between 1 to 10 or any range. It gives users some clues so that they can guess the correct number. Every time the user guesses wrong, they will get another clue. However, his score gets reduced. The clue can be smaller, greater, multiple, divisible, or even a combination of all.
